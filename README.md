# CS7290_project
Repository to hold the notebook code for my CS7290 project

To install required packages, run pip3 install -r requirements.txt

To reproduce results, run reproduce.sh

Assumes presence of raw data in ./All_Raw_Data/, as well as user2type.json and user2ethnicity.json in ./data/

Contact me at manzon.m@northeastern.edu for data or models at any point in the reproduction process.

To obtain final results afterwards, run the 'engagement_and_topics' and 'share_and_reply_analysis' notebooks.
